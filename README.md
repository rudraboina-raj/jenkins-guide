Continous Integration:

It is the frequent, automatic integration of code, All new and modified code is automatically tested with master code.

Continous Delivery:

It is the extension of CI. it ensures that the Code is alway ready to be deployed, although manual approval is required to actually deploy the Software to production.

Continous deployment:

Automatically deploy all validated changes to production. 
Frequent feedback enables issues to be found and fixed quickly.

Why we need CI/CD?

→ Detect bugs and problems in early stages of SDLC

→ Save Cost and efforts

→ Improves Co-ordination between teams, implement innovative ideas .

→Faster release to production system.

→ Automated testing helps deliver a top-notch quality product.

 → Minimum human intervention, hence less chances of manual errors.
